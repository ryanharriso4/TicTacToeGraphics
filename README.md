# TicTacToeGraphics
The goal is to create a working TicTacToe program that uses java's Swing library for graphics


My goals for this project:
  - Gain experience planning projects with UML Diagrams before writing them
  - Gain experience using the java documentation tools
  - Try to build a solid base program that will allow me to add new elements later on

What I want to accomplish before adding graphics: 
  - A class Box which repersents one box on a tic tac toe board 
  - A class Board which repersents the entire tic tac toe board
  - An AI which can read the board and choose the best move 
Once everything above is finished I want to create the graphical repersentation of the game

Extra things that would be cool to add: 
  - The ablility to load and store information from games
  - Something to make the game run like an app such as a launcher so that it would be easier for the average user to play
  -
