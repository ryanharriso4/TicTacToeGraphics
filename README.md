# TicTacToeGraphics
The goal is to create a working TicTacToe program that uses java's Swing library for graphics


My goals for this project:
  - Gain experience planning projects with UML Diagrams before writing them
  - Try to build a solid base program that will allow me to add new elements as I go

Main goal
  - Create a class Board which will represent the whole tic tac toe board
  - Create a class MainWin that will display the information stored in board
