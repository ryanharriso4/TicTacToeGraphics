# TicTacToeGraphics
The goal is to create a working TicTacToe program that uses java's Swing library for graphics


My goals for this project:
  - Gain experience planning projects with UML Diagrams before writing them
  - Gain experience using the java documentation tools
  - Try to build a solid base program that will allow me to add new elements as I go

What I want to accomplish before adding graphics: 
  - A class Board which repersents the entire tic tac toe board
  - An AI which can read the board and choose the best move 
  
Once everything above is finished I want to create the graphical repersentation of the game

Extra things that would be cool to add: 
  - The ablility to load and store information from games
  - The ability to run the app with a icon through a launcher or other system. This would make it easier for the average user to play because they wouldn't have to go  through the command line.
